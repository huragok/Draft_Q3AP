\section{Introduction}
% Why are we interested in the cooperative relay-HARQ channel? Why MoDiv?
In modern wireless communication, high rate data transmission often leads
to reception errors. To overcome packet loss due to transmission errors, 
Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) or Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) are important mechanism for
better reliability. HARQ in conjunction with relay networks has attracted great
deal of research interest in recent years~\cite{ngo2014hybrid}. Because symbols
transmitted in practice often utilize linear modulations of finite-size
constellation (e.g., Q-ary PSK, or Q-ary QAM), the performance of cooperative
relay-HARQ systems can benefit from Modulation Diversity 
(MoDiv)~\cite{benelli1992new}, in which each
group of $\log_2 Q$ bits are mapped to different constellation points across
different links and in different transmissions. 

There is a number of research works on MoDiv for relay
network~\cite{seddik2008trans, khormuji2008rate} and relay-HARQ
system~\cite{kim2009design, ryu2011ber, yu2012power}. Despite the encouraging
performance gain, the afore-mentioned works all assume a low bandwidth
efficiency scheme where (re)transmissions on the Source-Destination (S-D) link
and the Relay-Destination (R-D) links occupy orthogonal bands or time slots.
From this point of view, we study the MoDiv design in a relay-HARQ networks in
Fig.~\ref{fig:system_model} where the S-D and R-D links are coordinatedly additive as in
\cite{cover1979capacity, nabar2004fading,azarian2005achievable}, practically
forming a 2-by-1 multiple-input single-output (MISO) diversity system. In this
context, we formulate the bit error rate (BER) minimization MoDiv design into a
quadratic three-dimensional assignment problem (Q3AP). Though Q3AP is NP-hard so
that the MoDiv design problem can not be solved exactly in practice even for a
middle size constellation such as 16-QAM, there are a number of heuristic
algorithms~\cite{drezner2008extensive, james2009multistart,benlic2015memetic}
for its reduced form, Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), that results in
high-quality solutions over the QAPLIB dataset~\cite{burkard1997qaplib}. In this
work, we adopt an efficient modified Iterated Local Search (ILS) method to solve
the Q3AP formulated from BER-minimization MoDiv design problem. Our numerical
results demonstrate significant BER reduction over non-MoDiv HARQ schemes.
Moreover, we also show that when the channels are heavily fading, a comparable
performance gain is offered by an effortless heuristic MoDiv scheme.

\section{System Model}
\label{sec:model}
% Cooperative relay-HARQ channel 
We consider the cooperative relay-HARQ network shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:system_model}. There are two phases in this transmission system.
In phase 1, source node broadcasts its packet that can be received by both the
destination and the relay. In phase 2 of this HARQ setup, upon packet loss,
both the relay and the source node cooperatively retransmit the lost packet
information to the destination. Our goal is to design the H-ARQ constellation
mapping for modulation diversity such that the packet BER at the receiver is
minimized.

Denote $\mathcal{C}$ as the constellation used by this relay network whose size
is $Q = |\mathcal{C}|$. In the first phase, the source converts a bit sequence
of length $\log_2Q$ into symbols with Gray mapping $\psi_0: \{0,\ldots,Q -
1\}\rightarrow \mathcal{C}$. The bit sequence is indexed by its decimal
equivalence $p\in \{0,\ldots,Q - 1\}$. The source transmits $\psi_0[p]$ to the
destination via channel $h_0$ which is also overheard by the decode-and-forward
(DF) relay. We assume that this relay is placed strategically such that it has
negligible decoding error rate as in~\cite{ryu2011ber, kim2009design}. Upon
receiving a request for retransmission, the second phase begins with
the source and the relay remapping $p$ into $\psi_1[p]$ and $\psi_2[p]$,
respectively.  In general,  $\psi_1\not=\psi_0$ and $\psi_2\not=\psi_0$. The
remapped symbols are transmitted simultaneously on the same frequency band to the
destination via channels $h_1$ and $h_2$. In summary, the received signals at the
destination during the two phases are, respectively, 
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
       y_1 & = h_0\psi_0[p] + v_1, \\
       y_2 & = h_1\psi_1[p] + h_2\psi_2[p] + v_2,
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $v_1, v_2\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma_v^2)$ are additive channel noises.
Throughout this work, we assume the channels $h_0$, $h_1$ and $h_2$ follows
independent Rician distribution.

% ML demodulator
Assuming that the destination has perfect channel state information (CSI). Based
on the received symbols $y_1$ and $y_2$,  the destination decodes the data by
identifying the index $p$ via maximum likelihood (ML) detection:
\begin{align}
    \min_{\hat{p}} |y_1 - h_0\psi_0[\hat{p}]|^2 + |y_2-
    h_1\psi_1[\hat{p}] - h_2\psi_2[\hat{p}]|^2.
    \label{eq:ML}

\section{Optimal Constellation Mapping for Modulation Diversity}
\label{sec:core}
In this section we first formulate the minimum BER design of MoDiv into a Q3AP problem.
We then elaborate on the numerical approach for computing the input cost matrix of the Q3AP
problem. We then provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the Q3AP solution.

\subsection{BER Minimization via Q3AP solution}
% Q3AP formulation 
Assume that the information-bearing index $p$ follows a uniform distribution,
the BER can be upper-bounded and approximated using the pair-wise error
probability (PEP)~\cite{harvind2005symbol}
\begin{align}
    P_{\BER} \approx \sum_{p=0}^{Q - 1}\sum_{q=0}^{Q - 1}\frac{B[p,
    q]}{Q}P_{\PEP}(q | p), \label{eq:P_BER}
\end{align}
where $B[p,q]$ is the Hamming distance between the binary representation of $p$
and $q$ divided by $\log_2Q$ and $P_{\PEP}(q | p)$ is the probability for the ML
decoder to prefer $q$ over $p$ when $p$ is actually transmitted. According to~(\ref{eq:ML}), we have
\begin{align}
    P_{\PEP}(q | p) = P_{h_0,h_1,h_2,v_1,v_2}\{\delta(p,q,\psi_1,\psi_2) < 0\}.
    \label{eq:P_PEP}
\end{align}
In other words, given indices $p, q$ and the remapping scheme $\psi_1$, $\psi_2$, the
probability of the random variable $\delta<0$ being evaluated over the random
variables $h_0,h_1,h_2,v_1,v_2$, and $\delta$ is defined as
\begin{align}
    \delta & = |h_0(\psi_0[p] - \psi_0[q]) + v_1|^2 - |v_1|^2 +\notag\\ 
    &
    |h_1(\psi_1[p] - \psi_1[q])+h_2(\psi_2[p] - \psi_2[q])+v_2|^2 -
    |v_2|^2.
    \label{eq:delta}
\end{align}
In order to formulate the Q3AP problem, we introduce binary variables
\[
x_{pij}= \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
1,& \mbox{if $\psi_1[p] = \psi_0[i]$ and $\psi_2[p] = \psi_0[j]$}\\
 0,& \mbox{otherwise.} \end{array} \right. \]
Denote $\mathbf{x} = \{x_{pij}|\;p,i,j=0,\ldots,Q-1\}$
and constraint set
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{P} & = \left\{\mathbf{x}:\,\sum_{p=0}^{Q-1}x_{pij} = 1,
    x_{pij}\in\{0, 1\}\right\}, \label{eq:constraint_p}
\end{align}
and $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ which are defined as
in~(\ref{eq:constraint_p}) by replacing the summation index $p$ with $i$ and
$j$, respectively. Then from~(\ref{eq:P_BER})(\ref{eq:P_PEP})(\ref{eq:delta}),
the BER minimization MoDiv scheme $\min_{\psi_1, \psi_2}P_{\BER}$ can be
reformulated as
\begin{align}
    & \min_{\mathbf{x}}\sum_{p=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{i=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{j=0}^{Q-1}
    \sum_{q=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{k=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{l=0}^{Q-1}c_{pijqkl}x_{pij}x_{qkl},
    \label{eq:Q3AP}\\
    & \mbox{s.t. } \mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{P}\cap\mathcal{I}\cap\mathcal{J}.
    \notag
\end{align}
in which
\begin{align}
    c_{pijqkl} & = \frac{B[p, q]}{Q}P_{h_0,h_1,h_2,v_1,v_2}\{\delta(p,i,j,q,k,l)
    < 0\},
    \label{eq:cpijqkl} \\
    \delta & = |h_1(\psi_0[i] - \psi_0[k])+h_2(\psi_0[j] - \psi_0[l])+v_2|^2 
 \notag
    \\
    &
       + |h_0(\psi_0[p] - \psi_0[q]) + v_1|^2 - |v_1|^2 -
    |v_2|^2.\label{eq:delta_pijqkl}
\end{align}

\subsection{Computation of the Pair-wise Symbol Error Rate}

% serial expansion method
In this section we focus on the computation of the parameters $\{c_{pijqkl}\}$
of the Q3AP problem. According to~(\ref{eq:cpijqkl}), the key to compute
$c_{pijqkl}$ lies in the evaluation of
$P_{h_0,h_1,h_2,v_1,v_2}\{\delta(p,i,j,q,k,l)$, i.e. the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of the random variable $\delta(p,i,j,q,k,l)$ as
in~(\ref{eq:delta}).Define the moment generating function (MGF)
\[\Phi_{\delta}(\omega) = \mathbb{E}_{\delta}[\exp(-\omega\delta)].\]
Under the well known Rician channel model, 
$h_m\sim\mathcal{CN}(\mu_{h_m},\sigma_{h_m}^2), m=0,1,2$, we 
can extend the method
in~\cite{harvind2005symbol, taricco2002exact} to compute
$P_{h_0,h_1,h_2,v_1,v_2}\{\delta(p,i,j,q,k,l) < 0\}$:
\begin{align}
    & P_{h_0,h_1,h_2,v_1,v_2}\{\delta(p,i,j,q,k,l) < 0\} \notag \\
    & \approx \frac{1}{2v}\sum_{t=1}^v \Re\left\{\Phi_{\delta}(\xi +
    j\xi\tau_t)\right\} + \tau_t\Im\left\{\Phi_{\delta}(\xi +
    j\xi\tau_t)\right\},
    \label{eq:expansion}
\end{align}
where $\tau_t = \tan((t- 1/2)\pi/v)$
and $\Re\{\cdot\}$, $\Im\{\cdot\}$ denote the real and image parts,
respectively. 
The parameter $\xi$ is selected to ensure convergence of the
integration and $\xi = 1/4$ was suggested in \cite{taricco2002exact}. The
size $v$ of the expansion~(\ref{eq:expansion}) needs to be large when $
P_{h_0,h_1,h_2,v_1,v_2}\{\delta(p,i,j,q,k,l) < 0\}$ is small in order to
maintain an acceptable numerical accuracy.

To compute $\Phi_{\delta}(\omega)$, denote the Gaussian random vectors
$\mathbf{z}_1 = [h_0, v_1]^T$, $\mathbf{z}_{2} = [h_1, h_2, v_2]^T$, such
that $\mathbf{z}_m\sim\mathcal{CN}(\bm{\mu}_m, \mathbf{\Sigma}_m)$, $m=1,2$,
where
\begin{align}
    \bm{\mu}_1 = [\mu_{h_0}, 0]^T,& \; \bm{\mu}_{2} = [\mu_{h_1}, \mu_{h_2},
    0]^T,
    \\
    \mathbf{\Sigma}_1 = \mbox{diag}\left(\sigma_{h_0}^2, \sigma_v^2\right), & \;
    \mathbf{\Sigma}_2 = \mbox{diag}\left(\sigma_{h_1}^2, \sigma_{h_2}^2,
    \sigma_v^2\right).
\end{align}
Then~(\ref{eq:delta}) can be rewritten as $\delta =
\mathbf{z}_1^H\mathbf{A}_1\mathbf{z}_1 +
\mathbf{z}_{2}^H\mathbf{A}_{2}\mathbf{z}_{2}$, where
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \mathbf{A}_1 & = \left[
            \begin{array}{cc}
                |e_{pq}|^2  & e_{pq}^* \\
                e_{pq} & 0
            \end{array}
        \right], \\
        \mathbf{A}_2 & = \left[
            \begin{array}{ccc}
            |e_{ik}|^2 & e_{ik}^*e_{jl} & e_{ik}^*
            \\
            e_{ik}e_{jl}^* & |e_{jl}|^2 & e_{jl}^*

here $e_{ab} = \psi_0[a] - \psi_0[b]$. Then the MGF
is
\begin{align}
    \Phi_{\delta}(\omega) & = \sum_{m=1,2}
    \frac{\exp(-\omega\bm{\mu}_m^H\mathbf{A}_m(\mathbf{I} +
    \omega\mathbf{\Sigma}_m\mathbf{A}_m)^{-1}\bm{\mu}_m)}{\det(\mathbf{I} +
    \omega\mathbf{\Sigma}_m\mathbf{A}_m)}.
\end{align}

In our simulation, we implement the above procedure for 16-QAM and 32-QAM with
Armadillo library~\cite{sanderson2010armadillo} on a workstation with 48 cores and
finished the computation in several days for a $Q=32$ case and a few hours for a
$16-QAM$ case. For larger constellation such as 64-QAM, however, the time and
spacial complexity may still be too high. We will address in future works to
reduce this complexity by adding a few rules to restrict the remapping schemes.

\subsection{Q3AP Solution}
% Description of the Q3AP solution methods
For practical-sized constellation such as 16-QAM and 32-QAM, it is impractical
to apply the exact branch-and-bound algorithm~\cite{hahn2008quadratic}. Also,
our tests show that they do not have enough symmetry to exploit for faster
solution as does the 16-PSK constellation~\cite{mittelmann2015solving}.
Consequently, the MoDiv problem is solved with the ILS
method~\cite{hahn2008quadratic} extended from its QAP
version~\cite{stutzle2006iterated}. Starting from two random initial mappings
$\psi_1^{(0)}, \psi_2^{(0)}$, the algorithm executes a local search by
attempting to exchange the mapping of exactly 2 indices in order to lower the
objective function and whenever a reduction in the objective function is made
the mapping is updated. When it hits a local minimum, it executes a perturbation
step by exchanging the mapping of $k_p$ indices, where $k_p$ is adaptively
adjusted within $[k_{p,min}, k_{p,max}]$. The perturbation is accepted with a
probability defined as in simulated annealing, after which the local search is
restarted from the new mappings until the stopping criterion is satisfied.

\subsection{A Heuristic MoDiv Scheme}
\label{sec:heuristic}
The MoDiv design problem can be simplified if we force $\psi_1=\psi_2$. Also,
from~(\ref{eq:delta}), a simple heuristic is that the two indices mapped to two
symbols close to each other in Phase 1 should be mapped to two
symbols far apart in Phase 2. A simple remapping scheme based on this heuristic
is given by Seddik in~\cite{seddik2008trans}. We will show in the next section
that when the channels are heavily fading, this heuristic remapping offers
comparable performance gain as our Q3AP-based MoDiv.

\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:simulation}
% Simulation settings
In our simulation, all Rician channels are assumed to have the same Rician
parameter $K$. Also we assume that during the second phase, the phases of the
line of sight (LOS) components of channels $h_1$ and $h_2$ can be aligned at the
source and relay, respectively.
Consequently, we define $\mu_{h_0} = \mu_{h_1} = \sqrt{K/(K + 1)}$,
$\mu_{h_2}=a\sqrt{K/(K + 1)}$,  $\sigma_{h_0}^2 = \sigma_{h_1}^2 = 1/(K+1)$ and
$\sigma_{h_2}^2 = |a|^2/(K+1)$, where $a$ represents the ratio
between the amplitude of the LOS component of the
relay-to-destination and the S-D link. Throughout the
simulation we consider 16-QAM constellation, i.e.,  $Q=16$. The noise power is
parameterized with $E_b/N_0$ of the S-D link.

% Example of Q3AP mapping
First, we provide an example of Q3AP optimized MoDiv. When $E_b/N_0 =
2\mbox{dB}$, $K = 10$ and $a = 1$, the remapping scheme of $\psi_0$
(using Gray-mapping), $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ is depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:example}. For comparison we also plot Seddik's heuristic remapping
$\psi_S$. The results justify the heuristics mentioned in
Section~\ref{sec:heuristic} and both $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are essentially very
close to $\psi_S$. However, we note that in general $\psi_1\not=\psi_2$.

% BER Upper bound comparison
Next we compare the BER upper bound $P_{\BER}$, which is also the Q3AP objective
function, for three mapping schemes: the Q3AP optimized MoDiv, the heuristic
MoDiv $\psi_1 = \psi_2 = \psi_S$, and no MoDiv at all, i.e. $\psi_1 = \psi_2 =
\psi_0$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:BERupperbound}, there is a considerable performance
gain for MoDiv versus no MoDiv. Moreover, the gain of the Q3AP optimized MoDiv
over $\psi_1 = \psi_2 = \psi_S$ indicates that different rearrangements at the
source and relay during the cooperative transmission can further boost the BER
performance. However, as $K$ decreases, heuristic MoDiv becomes a good
approximation as the its performance gap with the Q3AP optimized MoDiv
diminishes.

    2$.}
    \label{fig:BERupperbound}
\end{figure}

% Monte-Carlo BER comparison
The performance gain of MoDiv for the cooperative relay-HARQ
system is further verified with the actual BER evaluated with Monte-Carlo
simulation in Fig.~\ref{fig:montecarlo}. We implement the ML demodulator
in~(\ref{eq:ML}) and evaluate the average BER of $M=10^7$ randomly generated
indices $p$. A similar trend as in Fig.~\ref{fig:BERupperbound} is demonstrated.

    10$, $a = 1, \sqrt{2}, 2$.}
    \label{fig:montecarlo}
\end{figure}

% Monte-Carlo BER mismatch comparison
Finally, we test the robustness of the Q3AP MoDiv solution against mismatch in
channel information. The intuition is that in practical systems, the CSI may not
be perfectly accurate and the phase of the LOS component of the S-D and R-D
links may not be perfectly aligned. Also, the Q3AP MoDiv scheme can only be
computed off-line for a limited number of channel settings a priori, instead of
for all possible combinations. We deliberately test the BER performance of the
Q3AP MoDiv solution for channel parameters $a=1$, $K=5$ while the actual channel
setting is $a = \sqrt{2}\exp(j\pi/12)$, $K = 10$. The BER upper bound and
Monte-Carlo simulated BER are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:mismatch}. Apparently,
the Q3AP MoDiv solution is not sensitive to the relative amplitude and the phase
alignment error between S-D and R-D links.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we investigated the modulation diversity (MoDiv) design problem in
a three-node cooperative relay-HARQ systems featured by the coordinated
retransmission from both the source and the relay. Aiming to minimize the bit
error rate (BER) upper bound, we formulated the MoDiv design into a quadratic
three-dimensional assignment problem (Q3AP), and presented an efficient modified
iterative local search (ILS) solution. Our numerical tests have demonstrated the
performance advantage of the Q3AP-based MoDiv design over simply repeating the
use of Gray mapping, and when the channel is heavily fading, a comparable
performance gain can be achieved with a heuristic MoDiv design.
